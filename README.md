<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The idea of this project is to create a
manageable electronic grade book for
secondary and high schools all over the world.
It can be both used by students and maintained
and used by teachers and managers.
</p>
<p>
The users, who log in to the
website, are divided into four groups: student,
teacher, manager and admin.
</p>
<p>
Students can see the subjects they study,
all unrated tasks they must do and all
rated tasks. They cannot change any information
on the site, as well as log in as a teacher
or as a manager.
</p>
<p>
Teachers can choose a class/grade and see all info
about its students, tasks, given to them and
their marks. Teachers can add, change or delete
any task and mark.
</p>
<p>
Managers can see any information about students,
teachers and disciplines. They can add, change
and delete students, teachers and disciplines,
but they cannot add, change or delete tasks
and marks.
